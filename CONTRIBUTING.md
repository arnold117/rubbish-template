# Contributing to the Rubbish LaTeX Template

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the official unofficial LaTeX template for *Rubbish*.

## Peer-Ignored Review Process

All pull requests undergo our rigorous **peer-ignored review** process:

1. Your PR is submitted
2. A maintainer glances at the title
3. If it compiles, it ships
4. Expected turnaround: 0 to infinity business days

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Quality

We maintain the highest standards of template quality so that the *content* can maintain the lowest. Your contributions should:

- **Compile without errors** on at least one operating system (we're not picky)
- **Not introduce `.doc` files** into the repository. We have standards.
- **Preserve the AIF of 100.** Any change that reduces the Absurd Impact Factor will be rejected (this would be a first)

### What We Accept

- Bug fixes (especially ones that make the template work *better* than the `.doc` original, which is a low bar)
- New features that enhance the serious appearance of fundamentally unserious content
- Translations of the template (especially into languages the editorial board doesn't speak, which is most of them)
- Typo corrections (ironic, given the journal's name)

### What We Don't Accept

- Microsoft Word files
- WPS Office files
- Google Docs links
- Napkin sketches (those go directly to the editorial board via Xiaohongshu DM)
- Pull requests that make the template look *less* professional. The whole point is the contrast.

## How to Contribute

1. Star this repository (mandatory, non-negotiable)
2. Fork the repository
3. Create your branch (`git checkout -b feature/even-more-rubbish`)
4. Make your changes
5. Ensure it compiles: `xelatex rubbish-template.tex`
6. Commit with an appropriately academic message
7. Push and open a PR

## Citing This Template

If your contribution leads to a publication in *Rubbish* (acceptance rate: 100%), please cite:

> 学术小狐狐 and Claude Opus 4.6. "The Official LaTeX Template for *Rubbish*: Because the `.doc` Template is, Well, Rubbish." *Rubbish*, 2026.

This will boost our AIF from 100 to at least 100.

## Code of Conduct

Be excellent to each other. Remember: we're all here because a `.doc` file ruined our evening.
